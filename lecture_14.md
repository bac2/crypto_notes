- Field of rationals R
- Pair of integers (m, n) &isin; &rationals;
- (pm, pn) = (m, n) where p &isin; &integers;
- i.e. m/n where m, n &isin; &rationals;
- Can extend this field by adding a square root 
    - (r1, r2) &isin; &rationals;(sqrt(2))
    - Because &radic;2 &notin; &rationals;
    - It is essential that &radic;2 isn't in the field already
        - If it was we would end up with problems with multiplicative inverses
        - &radic;2 is fine; &radic;3 is fine; but &radic;4 = 2, so won't do
- We can also talk about polynomials over the rationals
    - x<sup>2</sup> - 2 = 0 
    - This is an irreducible polynomial over the rationals
    - because there is no element x &isin; &rationals; s.t. x<sup>2</sup> - 2 = 0
    - Must be irreducible
        - x<sup>2</sup> - 4 = 0 would not work
        - x = ±2
        - Therefore one can factorise the polynomial
            - By dividing it by one of it roots
            - Recall long division -- you don't get a remainder
            - Can divide through by the root (x + 2)
    - x<sup>n</sup> + ... + c = 0 has at most n roots
    - Division of polynomials on a field just works
        - All the normal rules are there 
- Multiplication modulo a prime produces a Cyclic group of size p - 1
    - Take any field, finite 
    - 7 is prime, so this will work
    - Uses the Abelian group of order 6, can go for a more awkward one if you want
    - No repeated prime factors of 6 
        - Any group of size 6 is cyclic -- there will be a generator
    - There are only 2 groups of size 6...
    - Abelian group order 120..?
        - 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5
        - Has a repeated prime factor
    - Could be a number of groups:
        - C<sub>120</sub>, C<sub>60</sub> x C<sub>2</sub> and so on
        - Every element has order dividing 120 
            - because of what we have seen about orders of elements
        - because it is an Abelian group
            -  &lt;x, y | xy = yx, x<sup>60</sup> = 1, y<sup>2</sup> = 1 &gt;
            -  The element of highest order will have order 60 
            -  ALL the elements will divide this
                - If we did have &lt;x, y | xy = yx, x<sup>a</sup> = 1, y<sup>b</sup> = 1 &gt;
                - We could rewrite that as &lt; q | q<sup>ab</sub> = 1 &gt;
                - It is immediately obvious with an Abelian group that the orders of all the elements divide the elements of highest order
                - If the group is cyclic, then the element has order the size of the group
                - If it is not cyclic, then there will be some duplicated prime factors
                    - But they must be lumped?
                - Only common prime factors cause a problem

###An Example
- C<sub>4</sub> on the Kline group
- Cyclic Group of order four <table><tr><th>C<sub>4</sub></th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr></table>
    - 0 order 1
    - 2 order 2 
    - 1 and 3 order 4
    - Because it is Cyclic
        - Order of every element divides the order of the whole group
        - Two element are the generator
- The Kline group <table><tr><th></th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr></table>
    - Every element has order 2 
    - Except for 0 which has order 1
- If I have a repeating prime factor, it can be split into a vector 
    - group order pq<sup>2</sup> 
    - it can look like either:
        - (pq<sup>2</sup>)
        - (pq, q)
            - Where the element of highest order will be a generator of one of the elements of the vector
- The end result is:
    - Every element has an order dividing the order of the element of highest order
- Now we can use a polynomial trick
    - We know the order has to divide the size of the group 
    - The size of the group in this case is the prime p - 1 
    - Every element therefore must have the property that x<sup>p - 1</sup> = 1
        - Or x<sup>p</sup> - p = 0  
    - A field of size p, all elements must have and order than divides p - 1 
    - Furthermore, if the group wasn't cyclic, every element would have to satisfy x<sup>n - 1<sup> = 1 where n divides p
    - This seems to be getting unbearably painful...
- It isn't possible for the group of multiplication of a field to be non-cyclic
    - It is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> cyclic (even when you don't think it will be)
    - That means there is always at least one generator g 
        - s.t. g, g<sup>2</sup>, ..., g<sup>p -1</sup> constitutes all the elements of the group
        - This bound is satisfied by the case where there is only one element
- Following from La Granges theorem
    - x<sup>p - 1</sup> = 1 holds for every element of the multiplicative group 
    - x<sup>p - x</sup> = 0 holds for every element of the field
        - because we added the root x = 0
- Now for the excitement
- &rationals;(&radic;-1) works just the same
    - Root of the polynomial x<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0
    - And this is why complex numbers work!
        - Because there is no root, we can add the number in without breaking everything
- Ordering doesn't reeaally work for complex numbers
    - you can on the moduli but that isn't really complex numbers

##The Binaries
- I have the binaries...
- I want to make a bigger field out of the binaries
- First, find a polynomial that doesn't have a root
    - The linear polynomials are
        - x  : root = 0
        - x + 1  : root = 1 
        - Linear polynomials ALWAYS have roots
    - The quadratic polynomials 
        - x ( x + 1 ) = 0 Divisible by both 0 and 1
        - So add 1 
        - x (x + 1) + 1 = 0 
            - Can be written as x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1 = 0
            - Has no root
- We can add a new number!
    - Shall be known as "X" 
    - Has the property that X<sup>2</sup> + X + 1 = 0
    - Just like adding &radic;2, we can add this number, without breaking anything!
- Addition <table><tr><th>+</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>X</th><th>1+X</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>X</td><td>1+X</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1+X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>1+X</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1+X</td><td>1+X</td><td>X</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></table>
    - Klein group C<sub>2</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>
    - Addition is no cyclic anymore
- Multiplication <table><tr><th>*</th><th>1</th><th>X</th><th>1+X</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>X</td><td>1+X</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>1+X</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1+X</td><td>1+X</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></table>
    - Chuck the zeros away
- These are just two element vectors, but for some reason we write it like that
    - Could also be written as 
        - 0 =&gt; (0, 0) 
        - 1 =&gt; (0, 1)
        - X =&gt; (1, 0)
        - 1+X =&gt; (1, 1)
- Because it's binary, -1 and 1 are the same thing!
- This is interesting because
    - All of the encryption we have learned about so far 
    - Uses large fields of modulus a large prime
    - Pretty easy on a computer
    - In hardware, you would much rather work with bit vectors
- Hardware guys, love large fields of size a power of 2
- Software guys, love large fields of size a large prime number
    - A bit more secure

###An Irreducible Cubic Polynomial 
- Require no roots
    - Thus we need a plus 1, otherwise zero would be a root
    - Must have an odd number of terms, because then they will add up to 1
        - Can't have x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1 = 0
        - Because that gives 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, which is zero
- So we can have:
    - x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 1
    - x<sup>3</sup> + x + 1
- Could also build them up out of their factors:
    - x<sup>3</sup>; x<sup>2</sup>(x+1); x(x+1)<sup>2</sup>; (x+1)<sup>3</sup> -- Ruled out because no one on the end?
    - x(x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1) ; (x+1) (x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1)
- Every reducible prolynomial of order 3, over the binaries, has x or x+1 as a factor
- Both of the examples above are irreducible
- Can make a field of any size, 2<sup>n</sup>, by picking an irriducible polynomial
- For a big multiplicative group we might have:
    - 1, x, 1+x. x<sup>2</sup>, 1+x<sup>2</sup>, 1+x+x<sup>2</sup>, x+x<sup>2</sup> 
    - Can build up the whole group by taking powers of x
    - 7 elements - prime order: so every element but identity is a generator
- x is a generator of the group...
    - polynomial is irreducible, and primitive
    - Primitive means it it irriducable, and is a generator...
- Can write it down as powers of 2:
    - 2 gives 1
    - 2<sup>2</sup> gives 3
    - 2<sup>3</sup> gives 7
    - 2<sup>4</sup> gives 15 
        - As 15 has no repeated prime factors, it is cyclic!
- A group of size 15 is not of prime order
    - So not all of its elements must be generators
    - Additive group of size 15 the element 3 and 5 are not generators
    - But 1 is
- <strong>SHIT</strong>, he said something about exam questions
    - I will really need to review this stuff! 
- There is nothing magic about 2 
    - But people tend to use either 2 or a large prime

##Tangents 
###Cipher Conspiracy
- There is some security problem in something
    - Problem in AES CBC
    - Switched to RC4 to mitigate the problem
    - Then RC4 broke
    - Because no one has any faith in PKI 
        - Americans got all of the keys
    - Everyone should use perfect forward secrecy -- Diffie Hellman key exchange
    - Now it turns out that code for DH key exchange is broken
    - Bugs force people to move to more vulnerable protocols
