<h2>Lecture 5</h2>
<p><em>Lecture: Tue 4th February 2014 &nbsp;-&nbsp; Today: Tue 18th February 2014</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>Striking is fun</li>
    <li>People probably shouldn't be leaving themselves logged in</li>
    <li>Today (Apparently): Enigma, Tunny and Venona</li>
</ul>

<h3>Breaking Enigma</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Need to split the two parts of the cipher</li>
    <li>Small key size - brute force</li>
    <li>We can either build some machine to break it 
        <ul>
            <li>Probably electro mechanical in those days</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Or try to attack in with many people</li>
    <li>The bombe was that kind of device</li>
    <li>The scale of the project could have justifiably been of the 
        same kind of scale as war ships</li>
    <li>Codes of the day instruction
        <ul>
            <li>Which wheels to use today</li>
            <li>Pick three of five wheels (60 possible positions)</li>
            <li>Plugboard settings were also given </li>
            <li>And finally, the starting positions of the chosen wheels</li>
            <li>There is also another input wheel? Don't worry about it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We managed to nick the wheels</li>
    <li>The Poles actually worked out the wheels themselves...</li>
    <li>If you can get the codes of the day - then it is super easy
        <ul>
            <li>There were a few times that some of them were stolen</li>
            <li>Usually though that had to be worked out</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The code of the day wasn't usually used for the whole message</li>
    <li>The configuration used for that message would be sent in the master message</li>
    <li>Send the configuration to use as e.g. "DON DON"
        <ul>
            <li>Yay - A crib!</li>
            <li>1 &amp; 4, 2 &amp; 5 and 3 &amp; 6 are the same!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We have to get away from the actual characters being used</li>
    <li>Instead focus on the fact we know that the letters are the same</li>
    <li>Record the morse code </li>
    <li>A chap called Huds Smilo stits?
        <ul>
            <li>Passed information to a variety of people (French →  Polish →  British)</li>
            <li>Gave out the instruction manual </li>
            <li>Which gave out examples - which could be used to deduce the wheel design</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In general you want to tell your clark enough to know he is doing it right
        <ul> 
            <li>But not some much that leaking it would allow someone to know 
            exactly what is going on</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If we have a whole set of these 'initialization codes' then we can 
        try to work out the master code</li>
    <li>We need to abstract away what the letters actually are</li>
    <li>Because that is hidden by the plug board</li> 
    <li>The actual exploit works by finding loops
        <ul>
            <li>loop of length 1 - A corresponds with A</li>
            <li>loop of length 2 - F to Y to F</li>
            <li>with enough traffic we can fill out all 26 characters</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The plugboard does not affect these loops</li>
    <li>Using that information, we can build up rainbow tables for all the 
        possible wheel settings
        <ul>
            <li>Can build a book of it</li>
            <li>Very easy if you own a machine</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>On the day:
        <ul> 
            <li>Intercept a few messages</li> 
            <li>Extract the loop</li>
            <li>And look up the configurations</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once you have cracked the difficult cipher, 
        you can use frequency analysis on the intermediate text</li>    
    <li>Eventually the Germans realised their mistake, so stopped repeating the IV</li>
    <li>By this point, we had a pretty good idea of how to break it</li>
    <li>It's very difficult to fix a crypto system once it has been broken </li>
    <li>We knew it was possible to plant plaintext</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Weather ships</li>
        <li>Strategically plant mines in known locations</li>
        <li>We have seen these kind of messages before, so we know what they look like!</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The fact that the project was successful means that it is likely 
    to get more funding in the future</li>
    <li>Another problem was keys
    <ul>
        <li>Random three letter sequences generated by a cipher clerk</li>
        <li>But operators tend to have a set of keys that they pick from</li>
        <ul>
            <li>'SSS' on Monday 'TTT' on Tuesday</li>
            <li>'HIT', 'LER' or 'EVA'</li>
            <li>Fist that operator!</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Tangent</h3>
<h4>Credit cards</h4>
<ul>
    <li>If you steal four credit cards</li>
    <li>Even better if you can steal the drivers licence and get the date of birth</li>
    <li>You have a 1 in 10 chance of guessing the pin correctly
    <ul>
        <li>3 goes at PIN Sentry</li>
        <li>1 go at an ATM </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>How many wallets could you lift at Jesters?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Maybe six?</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Although what you really want is people who have a bit more money available...</li>
</ul>

<h4>ID Cards</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You can modify the card to give yourself gym membership</li>
    <li>You can change the barcode and take books out as the vice chancellor</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bletchley Park Punchup</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Code breaking museum vs National museum of computing</li>
    <li>Bletchley park are trying to drive out NMC
        <ul>
            <li>Put up fences and all kinds of things</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>Back in those days it was all women operating</li>
    <li>All men doing the maths</li>
    <li>Fortunately - times change</li>
    <br />
    <li>Charities often become crappy when the get money 
        <ul>
            <li>Because they try to become "serious world class attractions"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>National museum of computing own colossus
        <ul>
            <li>They rebuilt it themselves</li>
            <li>It all works</li>
            <li>Tape fed machine</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Generated a stream of pseudorandom numbers...
        <ul>
            <li>Can't use truly random numbers because they need to be the same at both ends</li>
            <li>The numbers weren't quite as random as we might like</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fish was called fish because it sounded like fish when listened to on the radio</li>
    <li>Broke the cipher two and a half years before they even saw a machine</li>
</ul>
