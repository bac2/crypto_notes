*Lecture: Mon 17th February 2014  -  Today: Tue 18th February 2014*

- I think this might need reviewing with my notes present

- Something about matrix multiplication (seem to have missed the first bit of the lecture)
- Rows into columns produces a new column
- ikth component of MN is the sum on j of M<sub>ij</sub>  and N<sub>jk</sub> 
    - MN<sub>ik</sub> = &Sigma;<sub>j</sub> M<sub>ij</sub>N<sub>jk</sub>
- If I then want to define MNP<sub>il</sub>
    - &Sigma;<sub>jk</sub> M<sub>ij</sub>N<sub>jk</sub>P<sub>kl</sub>
- And then we can bracket it in fun ways and make it equivalent to such
- If the matrices are finite dimensional then it is a finite sum
- If it is a finite sum then you can swap the order of the summations
    - It is possible to write the summations closer to the series
    - Commutative, associative etc over a field
- If it is and infinite sum (a Hilbert space) then it might cause problems
    - Infinite sums can't be reordered
    - Conditionally convergent series
        - Reordering the addition can change the order
        - Only ever happens if the series are infinite
- A field is something that behaves like the normal numbers
    - Supports + - * / in the usual way
    - e.g. the rationals
- Rationals behave rather like the addition modulo 7..?
- Without division, you get a ring
- You can multiply two nonzero matrices together and get zero
    - The example consists of: 
        - A matrix that projects onto the first component of a two component vector
        - A matrix that projects onto the second
- Matrices have the same problems as multiplication on modulo non primes
    - You get extra zeros that you don't expect
- To check a set of matrices is a group, you must show it is closed 
    - Under multiplication or addition
    - Check that you've got all the elements
- So long as the numbers behave like normal numbers (with + - &amp; *)
    - Only thing that can go wrong is that you get loss of zeros/closure
- Associativity happens by magic 
- Big key lessons:
    - Associativity is absolutely critical
    - It means that groups are and abstraction of operations on things
    - Really hard to take an arbitrary structure and show it is associative 
        - for an n element group, you have to try n<sup>3</sup> inequalities
    - Just build groups of things we know are groups 
- One way to check something is a group is to find a faithful matrix representation of it
    - If you can reproduce the group multiplication table using matrices
        - Then you don't need to check associativity
        - The table is closed by definition
    - Associate a matrix with each element of the group and check that multiplication works the way you think it does -- then you are done.
    - There are other ways of doing it... 
- To demonstrate that it isn't a group is much easier
    - Try to construct the matrices
    - If the matrices don't quite work 
    - Then associativity is probably broken down somewhere 
    - Pick a counter example 
    - The attempt to construct a faithful matrix representation will give you a good hint as to where the problem is 

###Permutations!
- Usually drawn like that (Pick Up sticks I guess)
- Natural split in the structure of permutations
    - You can count the number of line crossings
    - It can be odd or even
    - Parity is an invariant of the permutation 
        - Wiggly versions, keep the same parity of line crossing
        - Each extra wiggle creates a pair of line crossings
    - Odd followed by Odd is Even
    - Even followed by Even is Even
    - Even followed by Odd is Odd -- defines a subgroup structure
-  n! elements in the group (first has n, second has n - 1, etc)
- Permutation on two objects is abelian
    - Cyclic group with two elements -- ONLY group with two elements
- All groups of permutations contain the subgroup of the form C<sub>2</sub>
    - Counts whether the permutations are odd or even 
    - Always has a subgroup, you can carry around by ignoring all features other than whether it is an odd or even number... True of all permutations
    - Unless n = 2 the subgroup is smaller than the group
- All even permutations stay even 
    - Can think of group of even permutations only 
- Can throw away everything other than the oddness or evenness 
    - Get a group of size two
- Can throw away all the odd permutations
    - Because whenever you combine two odds you get and even 
    - So even permutations on their own form a group
- Two different ways of breaking up S<sub>3</sub> :
    - C<sub>2</sub> and  C<sub>3</sub>
    - S<sub>3</sub> is not the direct product of these two groups
- To make a group of size 6
    - Have a vector with one element 0, 1 or 2, and the other 0 or 1
    - Add the first up modulo 3, the second up modulo 2
    - Now a total of six elements
- That group of 6 is not the same as the product of C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> of permutations
- (1,1) is 1 like element (0, 0) is our 0 like element
- Keep adding 1 to itself
    - 1 + 1 = (2, 0) 
    -  => (0, 1)
    -  => (1, 0)
    -  => (2, 1)
    -  => (0, 0)
    - Just a cyclic group of size six 
- Direct sum construction only makes a new group if there are common factors between the elements 
- There are two distinct groups S<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>6</sub> both of which are of size six
    - One commutative, one not
    - There is only one commutative group of size six
    - (There are only two groups of size six)
        - There are no more that two groups of any size that has just two distinct prime factors
- We are only interested in commutative groups 
- There is only one commutative group with a size of a given product of two primes 
- For any number, the only way to have more than one commutative group is to have multiple identical prime factors 
    - e.g. for size of 4 there are two commutative groups 
        - C<sub>4</sub>
        - C<sub>2</sub> * C<sub>2</sub>   → The Klein group
        - The elements have different orders 
            - You must multiply things by different amounts to get back to identity
- Got a group with a size of prime times 4
    - How do we tell if it is:
        - A group of size prime x C<sub>4</sub>  
        - A group of size prime x C<sub>2</sub> x C<sub>2</sub>
    - Either:
        - The group has an order or element 4 
        - The group only has one element of order 2, the other has three
        - In Elliptic curves this is much easier
            - Something to do with the points where it crosses the axes 
            - For most choices you get an elliptic curve
            - For a few it is cryptographically vulnerable 
                - The NSA probably know some that we don't 

###Lagrange's theorem 
- Holds for commutative and non-commutative groups 
- Works by considering subgroups 
- Composing groups out of their subgroups is not trivial
    - Doing it in different ways can change commutativity
- Recently a complete catalogue of all the minimal groups was published
    - Groups that don't have "normal" subgroups
- There is a monster group...
- We have a group G and subgroup H
    - h and j are elements of H (h != j)
    - Then hj and jh are also elements of H
    - Operating on the sub group
- Can work out the cosets
    - Pick some g that is an element of G
    - And consider the set gH s.t gH is an element of the subgroup
    - gH is a set of elements of the group
    - |gH| &lt;= |H| 
    - if gh = gj then it is possible for gH to be smaller
    - BUT THEN ghj<sup>-1</sup> = g and hj<sup>-1</sup> some other element of the subgroup
    - They can't possibly have inverses 
        - g<sub>-1</sub> = h or j...
    - Therefore the size of the cosets is identical 
    - They can't overlap?
- Go and look up lagrange's theorem
    - The cosets are either completely identical or completely disjoint
    - If there are m distinct cosets, then |G| is |subgroup|
- This is terribly important
- If I have a group of size P
    - I have factors of 1 and P
    - So there are only two subgroups, the identity, and everything else
    - 1 * g * g * g..... eventually equals 1
        - Can't ever get a lower power from a higher power
    - Powers of any given elements eventually bring you back to the identity
    - Identity generates subgroup of size zero
    - All other generate a bigger subgroup
- If the size is prime, then every subgroup is a generator of the whole group
    - ANY ELEMENT GENERATES THE SAME GROUP

- Note: the multiplicative notation is used to imply that it doesn't matter if they commute
    - We usually use the multiplicative notation for groups that don't commute 
    - If you see a +, you know that it does commute

###Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- Back to crypto!
- We have a group G, |G| = a large prime
- Raising to a high power is easy
    - Just do repeated squaring
    - g<sup>n</sup> taken O(log(n)) multiplications
    - Always true when multiplication is cheap 
- Alice and Bob 
    - Plus a bad guy called Eve
- Alice and Bob want to be communicate confidentially
    - They need a shared secret
    - They can use a shared secret as a key for a cryptosystem
        - And share information securely
- Agree Group G and a Generator g 
    - Where |P| is prime, that's easy 
- Alice invents and number m
- Bob invents a number n
    - Picking these truly random numbers is the bit you can break 
    - They should be random and unguessable
- Alice sends g<sup>m</sup>
- Bob sends g<sup>n</sup>
- They then both calculate g<sup>mn</sup>
- Eavesdroppers cannot work out g<sup>mn</sup> based on g<sup>m</sup> and g<sup>n</sup>
- This relies on factorisation being a slightly tricky problem!

##Tangents 
- NSA did try to get a dodgy random number into an RSA standard 
    - NSA bribed RSA to use dual elliptic curves in be safer 
    - Researchers said it was no good
    - Government kept pushing it
    - Microsoft researchers eventually found the backdoor (2005)
    - RSA Kept on trying to push this random number generator in their products
    - Last year (2013) RSA finally pulled the RNG
- Its a shame because RSA used to be good guys
    - They were heavily against the use of the clipper chip
    - But now they have been sold on, they take bribes :)
