- There is no ordering
    - Can't reason about inequalities
    - If you love obscure systems, then you can uses Kleene Algebras
    - These are basically the same as regular expressions
        - Recall: Kleene Star
- {0, 1, 2} is the set
    - Can introduce a new number: &radic;2
        - Because 2 is not a perfect square
        - So isn't a number in this field
    - x<sup>2</sup> = 2
    - x<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0
        - This is an irreducible polynomial
    - New number x is &radic;2
- Can make the field bigger, just like we did before

    - There is a subfield that doesn't involve x at all
